                    <h2>Halifax, Nova Scotia</h2>
                </header>
            <p>Halifax, legally the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. The metropolitan area had a population of 414,400 in 2015 with 297,943 in the urban area centred on Halifax Harbour. The regional municipality consists of four former municipalities that were amalgamated in 1996; Halifax, Dartmouth, Bedford, and the Municipality of Halifax County.</p>
            
            <h3>Things You Don’t Know About Halifax</h3>
            <p>You likely know that Halifax is Canada’s largest city east of Quebec. It was founded in 1749 by Governor Edward Cornwallis and has more pubs per capita than any other city in Canada. (Although Montreal and St. John’s occasionally challenge that claim). There’s a cannon on Citadel Hill that fires every day at noon and a cartoon tugboat ambles around the harbour. But even though most of us know quite a bit about our fascinating, historic city, there are a lot of things you don’t know. </p>
            
            <p>Some of them are here:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Halifax-Dartmouth ferry</strong> –The Halifax-Dartmouth ferry service is the oldest continually operational saltwater ferry service in North America.</li>
                        <li><strong>Halifax Pop Explosion</strong> – From 1996 to 1999, Halifax Pop Explosion was called “Halifax on Music.”</li>
                        <li><strong>Motion photographs</strong> – In 1912, people gathered in the Orpheus Theatre on Granville Street to watch 1,000 feet of “motion photographs” called Scenes Incidental to the Awful Titanic Disaster.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dalhousie Gazette</strong> – The Dalhousie Gazette, established in 1868, is the longest running college newspaper in Canada</li>
                        <li><strong>Seattle of the North</strong> – In the early 1990s, Halifax was known as “Seattle of the North” because of the success of bands like Sloan, The Super Friendz and Thrush Hermit.</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote><p>At Last, Nova Scotia has a long history of crafting beer, all the way back to the earliest days of European settlement. And lately, the province has enjoyed an explosion of craft beer. In October 2015, the second Atlantic Canadian Beer Awards took place with a total of 152 entries from four provinces in 16 different categories.</p>
            
            <h3>Halifax Topography</h3>
            <p> The Halifax Regional Municipality occupies an area of 5,577 square kilometres (2,353 sq mi),(approximately 10% of Nova Scotia) comparable to the province of Prince Edward Island, and measures approximately 165 kilometres (102.5 mi) in length between its eastern and western-most extremities, not including Sable Island. </p>
            <p> The coastline is heavily indented, accounting for its length of approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi), with the northern boundary of the municipality usually being between 50-60 kilometres (30-37 mi) inland. The coast is mostly rock with small isolated sand beaches in sheltered bays. </p>
